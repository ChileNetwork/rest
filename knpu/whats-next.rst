What's Next
-----------

Awesome work making it this far, seriously! We've covered all of the most
fundamental parts of REST, and you already know enough to make a really nice
API. The key is to think about resources and representations, to test each
part of your API, and to do things inside your code that will make your API
very consistent.

So what big things haven't we covered yet? Those big things include authentication,
Hypermedia and HATEOAS, Documentation, Content-Type negotiation, pagination
and a few other topics. Knowing these topics will go a long way to understanding
the rest of the conversation about REST and to help you decide what types
of things you want to use in your API, and which things might not be needed.

We'll cover these in our next episode. Seeya next time!
