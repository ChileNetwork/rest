title:  RESTful APIs and Hypermedia in the Real World
price:  0
length: ~
summary: |
    Making RESTful APIs is hard, really hard. There are a lot of concepts
    to know - hypermedia, links, rels, documentation/profiles and HTTP to
    name a few. And putting this all to life in a sane way in PHP is no small
    task. In this upcoming screencast, we'll learn about all of the new concepts
    around REST like HATOEAS and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    And we'll of course build a real API to show it all off.

    Release: We expect to release this chapter by chapter from late March
    into mid April. Subscribe and we'll email with details. It's taking some
    time, but we're really happy with it!
