title:  RESTful APIs in the Real World Episode 2
length: ~
summary: |
    Making RESTful APIs is hard, really hard. There are a lot of concepts
    to know - resources, representations, HTTP methods, status codes, etc.
    
    Episode 1 got us really comfortable with all the terminology. So in episode 2,
    we're attacking the *hard* stuff:

    * Using a serializer
    * Token Authentication System
    * Hypermedia and HATOEAS
    * Documenting your API
    * Content-Type negotiation
    * Pagination and filtering
    * A lot of other pieces in between!
    
    This stuff is not easy. But if you make it through, you'll be armed to
    attack whatever API need you have.
