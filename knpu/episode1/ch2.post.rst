Questions
---------

- it's a little odd that we just choose an avatar filename. If we're choosing
    the avatar (like on the site), then where can we get the valid list?
- should we send the userId in the POST when we create a user or get it
    from the authentication token?
    - use id or username as input for the user?
- preference to return anything with the 201?

Notes
-----

- note how we need to use a random username because we don't have validation yet
