title:  RESTful APIs in the Real World Episode 1
length: 1:45:05
summary: |
    Making RESTful APIs is hard, really hard. There are a lot of concepts
    to know - resources, representations, HTTP methods, status codes, etc.

    And putting this all to life in a sane way in PHP is no small task. In
    this course, we'll learn all the most fundamental concepts around REST
    and learn about the "rules" and the advantages and disadvantages of each.
    And we'll of course build a real API to show it all off. Topics include:

    * HTTP basics
    * Resources and Representations
    * Resource state, client state
    * GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE
    * Idemptotency and safe methods
    * Proper Status Codes, Location header and Content-Type
    * Testing your API
    * RFCs and where the "rules" come from
    * Advanced error and validation handling

    **This tutorial is still being released! Chapters on the left will become
    available as we publish them. :)**

    If you want to know about Hypermedia, HATEOAS, Documenting your API,
    Content-Type negotiation, pagination and more, these are **not** covered
    here, but will be covered in [Episode 2](/screencast/rest-ep2)!
