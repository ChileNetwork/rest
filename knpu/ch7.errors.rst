Steps
-----

- form validation in standard format
- handle invalid JSON format
- error codes idea
- exception listener to transform 404, 403, 500 exceptions to our JSON response

Notes
-----

- I don't like my test for errors yet
- look at ch4 - we might talk about errors with unmutable properties
- ConstraintViolationList is so damn heavy :/
- I'm going to squash into a single error per field
- potentially mention 422 (unprocessable entity)
