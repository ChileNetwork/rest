   In order to access restricted information
   As an API client
   I can exchange create tokens and use them to access information
+
+  Scenario: Creating a token
+    Given there is a user "ryan@knplabs.com" with password "test"
+    And I have the payload:
+      """
+      {
+        "notes": "A testing token!"
+      }
+      """
+    And I authenticate with user "ryan@knplabs.com" and password "test"
+    When I request "POST /api/tokens"
+    Then the response status code should be 201
+    # And the "Location" header should exist
+    And the "token" property should be a string
