+Feature:
+  In order to prove my programmers' worth against projects
+  As an API client
+  I need to be able to create and view battles
+
+  Background:
+    Given the user "weaverryan" exists
+    And "weaverryan" has an authentication token "ABCD123"
+    And I set the "Authorization" header to be "token ABCD123"
+
+  Scenario: Create a programmer
+    Given there is a project called "my_project"
+    And I have the payload:
+      """
+      {
+        "user_id": "%users.weaverryan.id%",
+        "project_id": "%projects.my_project.id%"
+      }
+      """
+    When I request "POST /api/battles"
+    Then the response status code should be 201
+    And the "Location" header should exist
+    And the "didProgrammerWin" property should exist
