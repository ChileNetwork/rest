 So here, the first thing we'll do is actually go and look up the token row.
 I don't want to get into the details of exactly how this all hooks up because
 I want to focus on REST. But I've already configured this class and created
 some code behind the scenes to take in a token string, which is the ``ABCD123``
 thing in our case and return to me an ``ApiToken`` object, which represents
-a row in that table::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Security/Authentication/ApiTokenProvider.php
-    // ...
-    
-    class ApiTokenProvider implements AuthenticationProviderInterface
-    {

-            $tokenString = $token->getCredentials();
-
-            // find the ApiToken object in the database based on the TokenString
-            $apiToken = $this->apiTokenRepository->findOneByToken($tokenString);
-            
-            if (!$apiToken) {

-            // ... finishing code that's already written ...
-        }
-        // ...

 Next, when we have that, we just need to look up the ``User`` object from it.
 Remember, the job of this class is start with the token string and eventually
 give us a ``User`` object. And it does that by going through the ``api_token``
-table::

-        public function authenticate(TokenInterface $token)
-        {
-            // the actual token string value from the header - e.g. ABCDEFG
-            $tokenString = $token->getCredentials();
-
-            // find the ApiToken object in the database based on the TokenString
-            $apiToken = $this->apiTokenRepository->findOneByToken($tokenString);
-            
-            if (!$apiToken) {

+length: ~
 summary: |
     Making RESTful APIs is hard, really hard. There are a lot of concepts
     to know - resources, representations, HTTP methods, status codes, etc.
-    
-    Episode 1 got us really comfortable with all the terminology. So in episode 2,
-    we're attacking the *hard* stuff:
 
-    * Using a serializer
-    * Token Authentication System
+    In the upcoming episode 2 of this series, we'll cover the hard stuff,
+    by continuing our real tutorial:
+
     * Hypermedia and HATOEAS
     * Documenting your API
     * Content-Type negotiation
     * Pagination and filtering
     * A lot of other pieces in between!
-    
-    This stuff is not easy. But if you make it through, you'll be armed to
-    attack whatever API need you have.

 Below that, let's add our first scenario, which is going to be one where we
 try to create a programmer without sending a token. Ultimately we want to
 require authentication on most endpoints.

 gives us a little bit of information about what went wrong. 
 
 So there we go! No coding yet, but we know how things should look if we don't
 send a token. If we try this right now - which is always a good idea - we
-should see it fail. By the way we can run one feature file at a time, and

 So let's go into ``ProgrammerController`` and fix this as easily as possible
 up in ``newAction``. I already have a function called ``getLoggedinUser()``,
 which will either give us a ``User`` object or give us ``null`` if the request
-isn't authenticated. What we can do is check if ``!getLoggedInUser()`` and

 exception called ``AccessDeniedException``. Make sure you have the right

-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/Api/ProgrammerController.php

 But first, how is this even working behind the scenes? If you were with us
 for episode 1, we did some pretty advanced error handling stuff at the bottom
 of this ``Application`` class. What we basically did was add a function that's
 called anytime there's an exception thrown *anywhere*. Then, we transform
 that into a consistent JSON response that follows the `API problem`_ format.
-So any exception gives us a nice consistent response::
-
-    src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Application.php
-    // ...
-    
-    $this->error(function(\Exception $e, $statusCode) use ($app) {
-        // ...
-
-        $data = $apiProblem->toArray();
-
-        $response = new JsonResponse(
-            $data,
-            $apiProblem->getStatusCode()
-        );
-        $response->headers->set('Content-Type', 'application/problem+json');
-        
-        return $response;
-    });
+So any exception gives us a nice consistent response.
 
 And hey, when we deny access, *we're throwing an exception*! But bad news,
-our exception is the *one* weird guy in the *whole* system: instead of being

+``BaseController`` and make this a generic function. Open up the

 Let's copy the logic in there and don't forget to add your ``AccessDeniedException``
-``use`` statement::

-    // ...
-    use Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AccessDeniedException;

-        if ($this->getLoggedInUser()->id != $programmer->userId) {
-            throw new AccessDeniedException();
-        }
-    }
-
-Perfect, so now go back to our ``ProgrammerController``. It's a lot easier
-to just reuse this logic. Let's also use this down in ``deleteAction``::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/Api/ProgrammerController.php
-    // ...
-
-    public function updateAction($nickname, Request $request)
-    {
-        $programmer = $this->getProgrammerRepository()->findOneByNickname($nickname);

-
-Now the only other thing that could go wrong, is if the user is not logged
-in at all and they hit ``updateAction``. Then, we would die inside this function.

 So before we call this function, we need to make sure the user is at least 
 logged in. If they aren't, then they are definitely not the owner of this programmer.
 
 So let's create another function here called ``enforceUserSecurity``. In
-this case, go back to ``ProgrammerController`` and grab the logic right here::

-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/BaseController.php
-    // ...

-    protected function enforceUserSecurity()
-    {
-        if (!$this->isUserLoggedIn()) {

-        }
-    }
-
-There we go. And from inside ``enforceProgrammerOwnershipSecurity`` we can
-just make sure that the user is actually logged in::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/BaseController.php
-    // ...
-
-    protected function enforceProgrammerOwnershipSecurity(Programmer $programmer)

-            throw new AccessDeniedException();
-        }
-    }
-
-And in ``ProgrammerController``, we can do the same thing and save ourselves
-a little bit of code::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/Api/ProgrammerController.php
-    // ...
-
-    public function newAction(Request $request)

+to be ``protected``. Now, when we have multiple controllers in the future,
+we can just re-use this method to serialize other resources, like Battles.
 
 Second, create a new function called ``createApiResponse`` with 2 arguments:
 the data and the status code. The data could be a ``Programmer`` a ``Battle``
 or anything else. Then we'll let *it* call the ``serialize`` function. And finally,
 create the ``Response`` and make sure the ``Content-Type`` header is set
-perfectly::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/BaseController.php

-    protected function createApiResponse($data, $statusCode = 200)

-            'Content-Type' => 'application/json'
-        ));
-    }
+perfectly.
 
 Back in ``ProgrammerController``, we can simplify a lot of things. Let's
 search for ``new Response``, because we can replace these. In ``newAction``
-we can say ``$response = $this->createApiResponse()`` and pass it the ``$programmer``
+we can say ``$response = $this->createApiResponse`` and pass it the ``$programmer``

-    // ...
-    
-    public function newAction(Request $request)

-        $programmer = new Programmer();
-        // ...

-        $response->headers->set('Location', $programmerUrl);

-        return $response;
-    }
+need.
 
 I'll copy this code and change the other spots in this controller. The ``deleteAction``
 returns a 204, which is the blank response. So there's no need to use this
 fancy serialization stuff here.
 
 Now let's try the tests again, so we can make sure we see *just* that same

-    php vendor/bin/behat

-And we do!
-
-To Serialize or Not Serialize Null Values?
-------------------------------------------
+one failure. And we do!
 
 This failure is caused by something specific to the serializer. In this test,
 the programmer doesn't actually have a ``tagLine`` - we could see this if
-we looked in the database:
-
-.. code-block:: gherkin
-
-    # features/api/programmer.feature
-    # ...
-    
-    Scenario: GET one programmer
-      Given the following programmers exist:

-        | UnitTester | 3            |
-      When I request "GET /api/programmers/UnitTester"
-      Then the response status code should be 200
-      And the following properties should exist:

-        powerLevel
-        tagLine
-        """
-      And the "nickname" property should equal "UnitTester"
-
-When the serializer sees ``null`` values, it has 2 options: return the property
-with a ``null`` value, or omit the property entirely. By default, the serializer
-actually omits ``null`` properties. We'll fix this, because I like always
-having the same fields on a response, even if some of the data is empty.

 Go back to the ``serialize`` function. To configure the serializer, create
 a ``SerializationContext`` object. Next, call ``setSerializeNull`` and
-pass ``true``. Now, pass this context as the 3rd argument to ``serialize``::

-    }
-
+pass ``true``. Now, pass this context as the 3rd argument to ``serialize``.
 There's not a lot you can customize in this way, but ``serializeNull`` happens
 to be one of them.

 Whenever I have an API, I like to have an object for each resource. Before
 we started in episode 1, I created a ``Programmer`` object. And this is actually
 what we're allowing the API user to update, and we're using this object to
-send data back to the user::
-
-    <?php
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Model/Programmer.php
-    // ...
-
-    class Programmer
-    {
-        public $id;
-
-        public $nickname;
-
-        public $avatarNumber;

-
-        // ... a few more properties
-    }

-Serialization: Turning Objects into JSON or XML
------------------------------------------------
+send data back to the user.
 
 So one of the key things we were doing was turning objects into JSON. For
 example, let's look in ``showAction``. We're querying the database for a
 ``Programmer`` object, using a simple database-system I created in the background.
 Then ultimately, we pass that object into the ``serializeProgrammer`` function,
 which is a simple function we wrote inside this same class. It just takes
-a ``Programmer`` object and manually turns it into an array::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/Api/ProgrammerController.php
-    // ...
-    
-    public function showAction($nickname)
-    {
-        $programmer = $this->getProgrammerRepository()->findOneByNickname($nickname);
-
-        // ...
-        $data = $this->serializeProgrammer($programmer);
-        $response = new JsonResponse($data, 200);
-
-        return $response;
-    }
-
-    // ...
-    private function serializeProgrammer(Programmer $programmer)
-    {
-        return array(
-            'nickname' => $programmer->nickname,
-            'avatarNumber' => $programmer->avatarNumber,
-            'powerLevel' => $programmer->powerLevel,
-            'tagLine' => $programmer->tagLine,
-        );
-    }

-Creating/Configuring the Serializer Object
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
 While we're waiting, let's go back and look at the usage a little bit. What
 we'll do is create an object called a "serializer", and there's this ``SerializerBuilder``
 that helps us with this. Then we'll pass it some data, which for us will
 be a ``Programmer`` object or a ``Battle`` object. And then it returns to
-you the actual JSON string. So it takes an object and turns it into a string::
-
-    // from the serialization documentation
-    $serializer = JMS\Serializer\SerializerBuilder::create()->build();
-    $jsonContent = $serializer->serialize($data, 'json');
-    echo $jsonContent; // or return it in a Response
+you the actual JSON string. So it takes an object and turns it into a string.
 
 Now this is a little bit specific to Silex, which is the framework we're
 building our API on, but in Silex, you have a spot where you can globally
 configure objects that you want to be able to use. They're called services.
 I'll create a new global object called ``serializer`` and we'll use code
 similar to what you just saw to create the ``serializer`` object. We're doing
-this because it will let me access that object from any of my controllers::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Application.php
-    // ...
-    
-    private function configureServices()
-    {
-        // ...
-        
-        $this['serializer'] = $this->share(function() use ($app) {
-            // todo ...
-        });
-    }
+this because it will let me access that object from any of my controllers.

 In other words, don't try to transform them in any way. And that's it!

-Using the Serializer Object
----------------------------
-
 The important thing here is that we have a ``serializer`` object and we can
 access it from any of our controllers. Let's open our ``ProgrammerController``
 and rename ``serializeProgrammer`` to just ``serialize`` since it can serialize
-anything.

-I've setup my application so that I can reference any of those global objects
-by saying ``$this->container['serializer']``. This will look different for
-you: the important point is that we need to access that object we just configured.
+anything. I've setup my application so that I can reference any of those
+global objects by saying ``$this->container['serializer']``. This will look
+different for you: the important point is that we need to access that object
+we just configured.
 
 Now, just call ``serialize()`` on it, just like the documentation told us.
 I'll put ``json`` as the second argument so we get JSON. The serializer can
-also give us another format, like XML::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/Api/ProgrammerController.php
-    // ...
-
-    protected function serialize($data)
-    {
-        return $this->container['serializer']->serialize($data, 'json');
-    }

 Perfect! Now let's look to see where we used the ``serializeProgrammer``

+function before. That old function return an array, but ``serialize`` now
 returns the JSON string. So now we can return a normal ``Response`` object
 and just pass the JSON string that we want. The one thing we'll lose is the
 ``Content-Type`` header being set to ``application/json``, but we'll fix
-that in a second::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/Api/ProgrammerController.php
-    // ...
-
-    public function newAction(Request $request)
-    {
-        $programmer = new Programmer();

-
-        $json = $this->serialize($programmer);
-        $response = new Response($json, 201);
-
-        // ... setting the Location header
-
-        return $response;
-    }

+that in a second. Let's go and make similar changes to the rest of our code.
 
 In fact, when we have the collection of ``Programmer`` objects, things get 
 much easier. We can pass the entire array of objects and it's smart enough 
 to know how to serialize that. You can already start to see some of the 
-benefits of using a serializer::
-
-    // src/KnpU/CodeBattle/Controller/Api/ProgrammerController.php
-    // ...
-
-    public function listAction()
-    {
-        $programmers = $this->getProgrammerRepository()->findAll();
-        $data = array('programmers' => $programmers);
-        $json = $this->serialize($data);
-
-        $response = new Response($json, 200);
-
-        return $response;
-    }
+benefits of using a serializer.
 
 Compared with what we had before, not a lot should have changed, because
 the serializer should give us a JSON structure with all the properties in
 ``Programmer``. That's practically the same as we were doing before.
